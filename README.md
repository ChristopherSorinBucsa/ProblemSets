<h1>Description</h1>
 In this section, you'll find a collection of solutions for various problem sets related to network analysis. My aim is to guide you through my thought process in answering the specified questions. These problem sets cover a wide range of topics, including the foundational aspects of networks, node degrees, link indicators, network formulas, adjacency matrices, histograms showcasing node degrees, paths within networks, and the dynamics of triangles, v-shapes, and clustering in network structures.
